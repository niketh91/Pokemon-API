# Pokemon API Data Engineering Project

##Introduction
This project is a data engineering pipeline built using Python to extract, transform, and organize data from the PokéAPI. It focuses on retrieving and structuring data about Pokémon, their species, and abilities, storing it in a clean and relational format suitable for further analysis or integration into downstream systems.

The main goal is to demonstrate how to:
 - Build and manage data pipelines using real-world APIs.
 - Clean, transform, and merge multiple datasets.
 - Apply efficient data structuring practices for analytics and visualization.
